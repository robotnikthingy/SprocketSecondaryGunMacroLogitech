# SprocketSecondaryGunMacroLogitech

A simple script for Logitech Mice for the game Sprocket, which allows you to use the Right Mouse Button to fire weapons from the second fire group, instead of having to manually switch between fire group each time. Basically, it allows you to use the Left mouse button to fire from your main gun, and your Right mouse button to fire from secondary guns

Requires Logitech G-series mouse or keyboard
